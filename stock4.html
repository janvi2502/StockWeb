            The movements of the prices in global, regional or local markets are
            captured in price indices called stock market indices, of which
            there are many, e.g. the S&P, the FTSE and the Euronext indices.
            Such indices are usually market capitalization weighted, with the
            weights reflecting the contribution of the stock to the index. The
            constituents of the index are reviewed frequently to include/exclude
            stocks in order to reflect the changing business environment.
            Financial innovation has brought many new financial instruments
            whose pay-offs or values depend on the prices of stocks.

            Stock that a trader does not actually own may be traded using short
            selling; margin buying may be used to purchase stock with borrowed
            funds; or, derivatives may be used to control large blocks of stocks
            for a much smaller amount of money than would be required by
            outright purchase or sales.
